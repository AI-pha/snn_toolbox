Possible extensions
-------------------

* Visualize network: `draw_convnet <https://github.com/gwding/draw_convnet>`_
* Implement parser for Torch-input
* Implement export for Megasim
* Implement max-pooling layers (in progress)
* Test batch-normalization layers (implemented)
* Implement nonzero biases for pyNN and Brian2 simulators (working for INIsim).
  Currently, biases in our pyNN export are included as offset currents, but
  this does not seem to have any effect.
