Getting started
===============

In a terminal window, type ``snntoolbox -h`` to get all command-line options.

The basic use is::

   snntoolbox settings.txt -t

The positional argument ``settings.txt`` specifies the path to a text file containing the settings to be used (in form of a python dictionary).

With ``-t``, we tell the program to stay in the terminal. Omitting this flag opens the GUI (beta).

See :doc:`examples` for typical usecases.
