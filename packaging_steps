This is a reminder how to prepare a python package for distribution.

1.) Configure project with setup.py, setup.cfg, README.rst, LICENSE.txt etc. as described here:
http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/distributing/

2.) Build a Wheel package by calling
python setup.py bdist_wheel

This should create a Universal Wheel (pure Python, compatible with Python 2 and 3)
if setup.cfg contains the flag
[bdist_wheel]
universal=1

Otherwise run
python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal
